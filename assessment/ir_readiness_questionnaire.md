# Incident Response Readiness Questionnaire (SME Version)

This questionnaire helps SMEs evaluate their readiness across all phases of an incident.  
For each question, score:

**0 = No / Not in place**  
**1 = Partially in place**  
**2 = Mostly in place**  
**3 = Fully in place and consistently maintained**

4. Are incident types and severity levels defined (e.g., low, medium, high, critical)?
5. Do you maintain a list of **critical business systems** and data that must be protected?

18. Do you have a list of systems or services where credentials must be changed after an incident?

# Scoring Summary

- **0–10 = Initial** (High risk; minimal readiness)  
- **11–18 = Basic** (Some processes exist; mostly reactive)  
- **19–25 = Intermediate** (Documentation + technical checks)  
- **26–30+ = Advanced** (Proactive, repeatable, measurable)
